**What will I see and what can I do when I'm logged into the app with my driver's license information or user ID and password?**
You will see all cars where you are a named insured (the names you see on your insurance ID card) or additional driver listed on the auto insurance policy. Being a named insured means your name is listed on that vehicleâ€™s insurance ID card.

Please note, if you have recently changed cars, there may be a processing delay before your new car displays.

Named insureds on the policy can:

View all trips in the past 30 days for all vehicles and drivers
See the discount amount for all cars where they are a named insured
See 2-week scores for trips recorded on their phone
Enroll the vehicle in Drive Safe & Save Mobile

Additional drivers on the policy can:

Note: Mileage and odometer readings are excluded from the Drive Safe & Save discount on certain policies in certain states.
