**How do I complete setup?**
Make sure you have the Drive Safe & Save app downloaded (text SAVE to 42407 for a link to download).
Log in to the app using your driver's license information or your statefarm.com® user ID and password.
In certain states, you may be required to take some steps in the Drive Safe & Save app to finish your enrollment. This includes accepting the consent to participate, verifying your email address, and confirming the address where you’d like your beacon mailed.
When the envelope with your beacon(s) arrives, take it to the car and follow the easy setup steps in the app (while not driving, of course). This will include connecting your beacon(s) to the app and providing odometer readings.
Note: Mileage and odometer readings are excluded from the Drive Safe & Save discount on certain policies in certain states.
