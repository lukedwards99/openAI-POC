**Will trips record if someone else is driving my car?**
To get the most from your discount opportunity, each driver of your car should download the Drive Safe & Save app and log in. If someone drives your car but doesnâ€™t have the Drive Safe & Save app on their phone (e.g., not a listed driver on the policy), the trip will only record if someone from the household is also in the vehicle and logged in to the Drive Safe & Save app. All recorded trips are used to calculate your discount.
