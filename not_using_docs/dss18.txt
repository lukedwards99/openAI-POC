**Do I need to open the Drive Safe & Save app to record trips?**
You do not need to open the app to record a trip. Once your setup is complete, trips will record automatically with your Bluetooth on and Location preferences set to Always Allow.

If you are missing trips, please refer to the Troubleshooting Tips.
