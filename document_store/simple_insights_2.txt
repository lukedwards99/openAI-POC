According to Forbes Advisor, the cost of auto insurance went up more than 17% from July of 2022 to July of 2023. Here are some reasons why auto insurance rates are going up, along with what you can do to help manage your car insurance premium increase.

Some reasons for an auto insurance rate increase
During the global pandemic that started in 2020, federal and local governments enforced shelter-in-place and social distancing guidelines. We then saw fewer accidents and less expensive losses, due to less cars on the road, schools being virtual and many companies allowing their employees to work from home.

But now, a few years after the pandemic, roads are busy again, many people are working in-office and schools are back to in-person learning. This has resulted in an increase of car accidents and injuries, which has caused car insurance rates to rise.
