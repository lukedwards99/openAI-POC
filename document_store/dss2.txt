**Does participating in Drive Safe & Save guarantee me a discount?**
Drive Safe & Save is a discountfootnote1 for participating customers. The Drive Safe & Save discount is based on your annual mileage and basic driving characteristics.

Your discount may vary from term to term based on your actual driving, but will not add a surcharge to your policy.

If you currently receive a premium reduction for low estimated annual mileage (under 7,500 miles annually for personal use) and your car is driven more than that, your premium may increase at a future policy renewal to reflect your actual mileage.

Note: Mileage and odometer readings are excluded from the Drive Safe & Save discount on certain policies in certain states.
