Is there risk in owning too many funds?

Yes. Although diversification may help your portfolio, it doesn't assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Over-diversification can dilute your investment results and hinder progress towards achieving your goals.
You need to find a balance between returns and risk with a select number of funds appropriate for your personal financial needs.
