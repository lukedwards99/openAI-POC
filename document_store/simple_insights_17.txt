What determines the cost of life insurance?
Factors that affect life insurance premiums may have a large influence on the price.

Life insurance can provide your beneficiaries with financial support when you pass away. The cost of the policy premiums will vary from person to person based on multiple factors.

Factors that affect life insurance premiums
Ultimately, life insurance policies are priced based your life expectancy. There are a variety of factors that influence the cost. These include:

Age
Younger people generally receive lower rates because they represent a lower risk to life insurance companies based on having a longer life expectancy. As you get older, there are more factors that may contribute to shorter life expectancy.
 
Gender
Men typically have a shorter life expectancy than women, and they generally pay higher life insurance premium rates.

Occupation
Working in a field such as construction or manufacturing is riskier than working in an office, so people working in those occupations typically pay higher premiums.

Lifestyle
Risky hobbies such as rock climbing, auto racing or being a weekend pilot can also drive up premiums due to the higher chance of accidents.

Driving record
A history of speeding, accidents and DUIs are other underwriting factors in life insurance. Having these incidents on your driving record can lead to higher rates because of the associated risky behavior that record entails.

Tobacco use
When it comes to pricing life insurance, companies know that tobacco use lowers life expectancy, and premium costs increase accordingly.

Family health history
Similarly, a history of serious health conditions in your family may lead to higher life insurance premium rates because it increases your chances of developing similar issues.
