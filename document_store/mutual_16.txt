What happens to an account if the beneficiary dies, becomes disabled, or does not attend college?

If the beneficiary of an account dies or becomes disabled, you are entitled to receive the balance in your account. Investment earnings will be taxed at your ordinary income rate. No federal penalty tax will be assessed and the trust will not assess a contingent deferred sales charge. You may also transfer the balance tax-free to an account for another beneficiary who is a qualified family member.
If your beneficiary elects not to pursue post-secondary education, you may either transfer the account balance to an account for another beneficiary who is a qualified family member or withdraw the principal and investment earnings in a non-qualified withdrawal.
