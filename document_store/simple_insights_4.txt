Why are auto insurance rates going up?

Increased accidents due to distracted driving
According to a State FarmÂ® survey, 67% of drivers said reading or sending texts while driving is distracting/very distracting, and over 70% of drivers report watching a video or recording video (67%) to be distracting/very distracting. Even voice-activated car commands can divert cognitive abilities and attention. Rethink using the phone while driving, and avoid being tempted by other driving distractions. If you have a teen, talk with them about safe driving habits. NHTSA research has found that the risk of accidents in teens is 23 times more likely when they are texting and driving.

Weather catastrophes
The U.S. experienced many weather disasters during 2023, several of them causing at least $1 billion in losses, according to Climate.gov. Among the weather catastrophes that our country encountered in 2023 were wildfires in Maui, Hawaii, historical floods in California and tropical cyclones. When severe weather strikes, it impacts the insurance industry and premiums can be affected. For example, State Farm paid $12 billion in catastrophic claims during 2023, compared to $7 billion paid in catastrophic claims during 2022.
