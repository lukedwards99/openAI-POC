**Is Drive Safe & Save only for drivers with spotless driving records?**
The Drive Safe & Save discount does not take into account tickets or accidents. Drive Safe & Save collects actual miles driven and basic driving characteristics (excludes OnStar) to calculate the discount.

Note: Mileage and odometer readings are excluded from the Drive Safe & Save discount on certain policies in certain states.
