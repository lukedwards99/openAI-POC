What's the difference between a 529 savings plan and 529 prepaid plan?

A 529 Savings Plan is a program that allows participants to invest in a special account designated for qualified higher education expenses. 529 savings plans offer a rate of return that depends on the performance of the plan's investments. As such, the value of a 529 savings plan account may increase or decrease over time.
A prepaid tuition plan allows parents, grandparents, and others to lock in today's tuition rates. The program will pay out future college tuition at any of the state's eligible colleges or universities (or make a payment to private and out-of-state institutions).
