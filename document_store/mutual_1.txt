Why buy a mutual fund?

Mutual funds offer you a diversified investment vehicle without requiring a great deal of money. Your investment and those of other investors with similar objectives are pooled to purchase securities.
A professional manager closely monitors the securities held within a fund portfolio to determine if they're meeting the objective of that fund. They buy and sell securities in an effort to get the best return for investors while maintaining that objective. There's usually a fee charged by fund companies for the manager's services. Those fees are normally a fraction of what it would cost you to make stock or bond purchases independently. See the prospectus for complete information regarding fees.
