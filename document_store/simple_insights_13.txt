What does homeowners insurance not cover?
The standard homeowners policies specifically exclude a number of perils from coverage. Policy coverage for these excluded perils can generally be added through an endorsement and payment of an additional premium. Typical policy exclusions might include the following:

Ordinance or law: Many homeowners policies do not cover losses or have limitations, due to a law or ordinance of the community in which the home is located. For example, if a home is damaged or destroyed, changes in building codes could result in additional uncovered expenses when the home is repaired or rebuilt. Ordinance or law coverage is included in some package policies often as a percentage of the dwelling coverage (10%, 25%, 50%, etc.). This coverage is required in some states.
Earth movement: Excludes loss caused by events such as earthquake, volcanic eruption, mudslide or landslide.
Water damage: Refers to damage from water that backs up from sewers or drains, water seeping through walls below ground or wave action. Many policies contain dollar limits for water damage due to such things as a broken pipe.
Flood damage: Refers to damage from rising water or surface water.
Mold exclusion: Many insurance companies exclude coverage for mold damage.
Other exclusions: Other specific exclusions include war, nuclear hazard, neglect and intentional loss.
