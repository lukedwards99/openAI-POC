Benefits and safety tips for Uber and Lyft

Ridesharing safety precautions
Is Uber safe? Is Lyft safe? Here are some ridesharing safety precautions to help you sit back and enjoy the ride.

Share your trip with others. If you don't need to travel alone, consider taking the carpool option. It allows you to ride with others who have a similar destination.
Keep your personal information confidential.
Request your ride before you go outside.
Check the driver's ratings and read the feedback before you confirm a pick up. Cancel the request if you are not comfortable with the driver.
Know your surroundings. Use the app to follow your driver's progress before they pick you up and while you are en route to your destination.
Verify the identity of the driver and car before entering the vehicle. The ridesharing app will show you the driver's photo, the vehicle's license plate number, and the make and model of the car.
Sit in the back seat and wear your seatbelt.
Consider wearing a face mask during times of a pandemic or when highly contagious illnesses are prevalent.
Remember — it is important to trust your instincts and use your best judgment if you ever feel unsafe.

If something doesn't feel right, don't get into the vehicle.
If your personal safety is threatened, call emergency personnel immediately.
Ridesharing isn't only convenient and budget-friendly for riders, it's also a great way for drivers to earn extra money. If you're interested in becoming a driver, it's important to make sure you understand the ins-and-outs of rideshare driver coverage.

Before becoming a driver, check with your State Farm® agent about rideshare coverage options.
