What is homeowners insurance and what does it cover?
After investing in your home, it's important to have it insured properly. What are all the policy coverages, forms and exclusions?

What is homeowners insurance?
Homeowners insurance is a type of insurance that will provide coverage for your home and other personal property in the case of a covered loss. It can also provide liability coverage if someone hurts themselves at your home or you cause property damage. Homeowners insurance is not only desired, but in many cases, required by your mortgage company so they will also be protected financially if your home experiences a covered loss.

Why homeowners insurance?
A home is the single biggest investment most individuals will ever make. It is typically the largest asset on the family "balance sheet." Also, the contents of a typical home, in the form of furniture, appliances, clothing, family heirlooms and other movable personal belongings, represent a substantial additional investment. The unprotected loss (or partial loss) of a home and its contents to theft, fire, windstorm or some other disaster, could be financially devastating. footnote[1]

Further, everyone faces the risk of personal liability. For example, a visitor to the residence could slip and fall. Such accidents can result in court decisions awarding large sums to the injured party for medical expenses and pain and suffering.
