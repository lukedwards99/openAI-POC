**Is my account number the same as my policy number?**
No. A policy number is an alpha-numeric code unique to each individual policy at State Farm. An account number is a 10-digit number associated with a State Farm Payment Plan (SFPP).

If you have questions about your policy or payment plan, please contact your agent.
