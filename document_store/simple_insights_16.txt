What happens when a level term life insurance policy reaches the end of its guaranteed level premium period?

Option 1: Convert all or a portion of your current term life policy to a permanent life policy
Most term policies have a conversion privilege, which allows you to convert all, or a portion of your coverage to Whole Life, and typically without undergoing additional underwriting or a medical exam. You’ll no longer need to worry about your premiums increasing every year because a permanent policy offers level premiums for as long as you live (as long as your premiums are paid on time), unlike a term policy, which only offers level premiums for a certain number of years.

Option 2: Purchase a new term life policy
Another option you have is to qualify for another term life policy. With this option, you’ll once again have guaranteed level premiums for the length of the term. This is a viable choice if you have a specific need for coverage, for a specific amount of time. For example, helping to provide money to pay off a mortgage, provide for education expenses or income replacement.

Option 3: Keep your current term life policy
You also have the option of keeping your term life policy even after the policy has reached the end of its term. However, as mentioned earlier, if you decide to go with this option, keep in mind that your policy will automatically convert to an annual renewable term life policy and your premiums will increase (because they’ll be based on your age at the time of renewal).
