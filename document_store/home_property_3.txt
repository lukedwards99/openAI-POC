How much insurance coverage should I have on my home?
The insurance coverage amount is your choice. We recommend that you purchase coverage equal to or greater than the estimated replacement cost of your home. Your home's estimated replacement cost also determines which policy options are available to you.

Since it's impossible to predict the cost to replace your home in the future, it's important to have enough coverage to account for unforeseen circumstances.
