What happens to contributions over the maximum limit?

Contributions over the applicable limit will not knowingly be accepted. However, if it's determined that contributions are over the limit, the excess and any earnings or losses attributed to the excess are refunded and treated as a non-qualified withdrawal that may be subject to a 10% federal penalty tax. No contingent deferred sales charge is assessed by the servicing agent.
