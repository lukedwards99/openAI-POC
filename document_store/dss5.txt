**Why doesn't my discount match the reduction in my premium?**
Your Drive Safe & Save discount includes any previous mileage-based premium reduction. If you previously received a reduction for low estimated annual mileage (under 7,500 miles annually for personal use), the Drive Safe & Save discount amount will include this premium reduction. Please note that if you currently receive a premium reduction for low estimated annual mileage (under 7,500 miles annually for personal use) and your car is driven more than that, your premium may increase at a future policy renewal period.

Note: Mileage and odometer readings are excluded from the Drive Safe & Save discount on certain policies in certain states.
