How do I check my life application status?

To check your life application status:
  1. Log in to statefarm.comÂ® to access your My Accounts page.
  2. Select Click Here to view the Life Underwriting Status. The Customer Life Underwriting Status View (CLUSV) appears.
Note: If you started the application on a different device than the one you are checking the status on, you are required to re-authenticate the new device on statefarm.com.
