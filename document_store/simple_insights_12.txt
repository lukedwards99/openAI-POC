What is homeowners insurance and what does it cover?

Homeowners insurance coverage
Originally, a standard homeowners policy covered only the risk of fire. Today's homeowners policies provide protection against a number of the perils of modern life, in one "package" policy. A typical homeowners policyfootnote [2] can provide insurance protection for the following:

Home: The physical dwelling structure and other structures attached to it.
Other structures: For example, a detached garage, pool house, guesthouse, green house or tool shed on the residence property.
Personal property: This covers the contents of the home, such as furniture, appliances or clothing. Certain types of property footnote[3] may have specific dollar limits.
Loss of use or additional living expense: If a home is damaged by a covered peril, loss-of-use coverage helps meet the costs of hotel bills, apartment or rental home, eating out and other living expenses if the home is uninhabitable from a covered loss. This policy section may also reimburse a homeowner for lost income if a room in the home were rented out. This is sometimes insured on an actual-loss-sustained basis.
Personal liability: Provides protection against legal liability for bodily injury or property damage if a third party is accidentally injured or their property is damaged.
Medical payments: Also known as guest-medical payments, this section provides limited coverage if a third party is accidentally injured and needs medical treatment.
