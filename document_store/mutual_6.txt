What else should I keep in mind after purchasing my funds?

Investing is not a one-time event. As your needs and goals change, you need to shift assets from one type of fund to another. For example, when you have over ten years to reach retirement, investing in stock funds makes sense because you have time to ride out the market's ups and downs. But within ten years of retirement, you might want to invest in more stable bond funds.
