Why are auto insurance rates going up?

Inflation
Inflation in the U.S. was at 3.4% in 2023. Even though it was not as high as the previous 2 years, it has been historically high compared to the last 15 years. This economic trend has affected the prices of many goods including groceries, gas, housing and cars. And because cars (both new and used) are now more expensive to get, repair and replace, it ends up affecting insurance rates.

Rising car repair costs
Supply chain disruption and labor issues that started during the pandemic and continue to this day, have impacted vehicle repair costs. This includes longer times to repair a car involved in an accident. As a result, there are additional costs associated with policyholders using a rental car longer while they wait for their car to be repaired.

Additionally, new technology, such as parking sensors, lane-departure warnings, and better battery technology, have added to the rising cost of repairs. While those smarter sensors and stronger devices can help improve safety, they are also more expensive to repair.

Electric vehicles
The ownership and use of hybrid and electric vehicles in the U.S. has become more popular in the last few years, with 16.3% of sales in 2023 compared to 12.9% of sales in 2022. Electric vehicles help the environment by producing less gas emissions, but they are more expensive to acquire, repair and replace, which can contribute to the increase of insurance rates.
