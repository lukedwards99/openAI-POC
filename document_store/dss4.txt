**How do I see my discount?**
You can see your current discount amount on your Drive Safe & Save account page on statefarm.comÂ® or on the State Farm mobile app. This information will be updated at each auto policy renewal (typically every 6 months).

Named insureds (the names you see on your insurance ID card) enrolled in Drive Safe & Save Mobile can also view this information on the Drive Safe & Save app.
