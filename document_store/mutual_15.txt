How does a 529 savings plan work?

To start an account for a beneficiary, you need to complete an account application and make an initial contribution. Contributions to your account will be invested in shares of the portfolio(s) you choose after deducting any applicable sales charges. Shares can be redeemed from your account to pay for higher education costs of the beneficiary.
