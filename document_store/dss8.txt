**How do I change my email address for Drive Safe & Save reminders?**
Drive Safe & Save emails are sent to the first named insured listed on the insurance policy for that vehicle. The first named insured is the first name listed on the insurance ID card for that vehicle. The first named insured may update their email address on file with State Farm by logging in to their statefarm.com account, then navigating to Communication Preferences under Profile & Preferences.
